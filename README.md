# 📸🧠 StoryCrafter: AI-Powered Visual Storytelling

Turn a series of images into a narrated short story using state-of-the-art AI models!  
This project combines image captioning, object detection, LLM-based storytelling, and TTS voice narration.

## 🎯 What It Does

1. 🖼️ **Capture or Load Images**  
2. 🧠 **Generate Smart Captions** using [BLIP-2](https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/blip2-opt-2.7b)  
3. 🔍 **Detect Objects** with [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)  
4. 📖 **Write a Genre-Specific Story** with [LLaMA 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/)  
5. 🔊 **Narrate the Story** using a cloned voice with [F5-TTS](https://github.com/TensorSpeech/FastSpeech2)  
6. 🎬 **Display it with Subtitles and Audio** — like a slideshow movie!

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Clone repo and cd into it
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/storycrafter.git
cd storycrafter

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run and take new photos
python main.py --photo

# Or run with existing images in the /images folder
python main.py

# 📌 At the end, press any key to view the narrated story frame-by-frame.

## 🎮 Choose Your Genre
You'll be prompted to select the story's theme:

vbnet
Copiar
Editar
What genre do you wish the story to be in?
Examples:

🧙 Fantasy

👽 Sci-Fi

🕵️ Mystery

🎭 Drama

🎉 Comedy

🦸 Superhero

...or make up your own!

This genre is passed as context to the LLM.

## 🧪 Voice Cloning (Optional)
Record a 20-second voice sample and save it as:
audio/reference_audio.wav

Edit the main.py to include a reference text that matches your voice (helps TTS align better).

Install and configure F5-TTS or your preferred voice model.

Make sure the CLI tool is available:
f5-tts_infer-cli --text "Your story here" --ref audio/reference_audio.wav

## 📽️ Output
Once the story and narration are generated, the program displays a slideshow:

Each image appears

Subtitles are shown

Audio is played frame-by-frame

You can save the audio (outputX.wav) from /tests/.
